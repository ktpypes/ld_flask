# LD Flask 
Created the world's simplest flask app to demonstrate a simple FF following this LD blog post- https://launchdarkly.com/blog/launching-darkly-with-python-and-a-star-wars-api/ 
This can be replicated by taking the .py file, updating the SDK and name of the feature flag. 
# Goal
- Going through demo cert content and looking for a simple example to help non-tech teams implement FF and understand simple workflows. This could be a great first expercise.
